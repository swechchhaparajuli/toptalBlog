    Education is expensive, and I’m lucky that I live in the United States where I have the privilege of having access to further knowledge and information. There was a time in my life where I didn’t have a free-flowing access to the internet, and when my parents could barely pay for me to go to school. As a woman, I’m lucky that my education has always been valued just as much as my brother’s which is not the case for a lot of women around the world. 
    Currently, alongside my mother, I am helping twelve orphaned kids in Nepal find sponsors for their education. The ages of these kids range from four to twelve and before this they were being held in an orphanage owned by people who were attempting to immigrate to the United States and didn’t care if the kids were all thrown out to the streets. 
    Originally, I had just been planning on helping them find sponsors and had worked on interviewing each of them in their native language to be shown to interested sponsors. As I continued to work with them and on their interviews ( my iPhone and the microphone found on the apple headphones being my only filming tools), I realized that there was so much more I could contribute. This led me to creating a website that potential sponsors could interact with to see which student they would be interested in sponsoring. 
    
    I am a Undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz majoring in Computer Science. While I had always been very active in social activism and participating in social issues alongside with being very into the subject of my major, I had never found a way to bring those two together. 
    With a lot of self-studying and a course at the UC Berkeley extension I started working on my own projects, navigating noSQL databases like Mongoose with Node.js for side project practice and finally to implement on my own web project of organizing sponsors with the 12 kids in Nepal that will now be attending a boarding school until they reach college. This organized sponsorship for these kids grew from just being able to take them out of that terrible situation in the orphanage to giving them a school where they can live and eat alongside with sponsors and mentors provided through my site. 
    With the toptal $10,000, I would pay for my final year of college to finish up my undergraduate degree. I completed a few lower-division requirements for my major at a local community college while also finishing the UC Berkeley extension course on Full-Stack Web Development but for my last year I have my upper-division courses on Computer Science to finish. With my degree, I will have the knowledge and access to tools which will help me make a greater impact and will also help me greatly in continuing this project in a larger scale. The lack of educational opportunities in Nepal for children, especially girls, is appalling and having the knowledge to work with that data to create a better and more secure tool is my goal.
