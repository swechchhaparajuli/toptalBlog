      <hr>
      <p id="mission">I am an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz majoring in Computer Science. While I had always been very active in social activism and participating in social issues along with being very into the subject of my major, I had never found a way to bring those two together. With a lot of self-studying and a course at the UC Berkeley extension I started working on my own projects, navigating noSQL databases like Mongoose with Node.js for side project practice and finally to implement on my own web project of organizing sponsors with the 12 kids in Nepal that will now be attending a boarding school until they reach college. This organized sponsorship for these kids grew from just being able to take them out of that terrible situation in the orphanage to giving them a school where they can live and eat alongside with sponsors and mentors provided through my site. With the toptal $10,000, I would finish up my undergraduate degree which is just one more year. While working on this project I completed a few lower-division requirements for my major at a local community college while also finishing the UC Berkeley extension course on Full-Stack Web Development. However, I now have only my upper-division courses on Computer Science left before I complete my undergraduate degree. With my degree, I will have the knowledge and access to tools which will help me make a greater impact and will also help me greatly in continuing this project in a larger scale. The lack of educational opportunities in Nepal for children, especially girls, is appalling and having the knowledge to work with that data to create a better and more secure tool is my goal.</p>

  <h1> The Sponsor A Child Project </h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="idea">
    The idea for this project began when my mother and I visited Nepal this past summer. We visited an orphanage in the Budanilikantha District in Kathmandu and met 12 children ranging from the ages of four to twelve. They were being held in an orphanage owned by people who were attempting to immigrate to the United States and no longer held the lives of these kids as a priority. 
    All of these kids attended a local public school, which in Nepal, means that their education can be severely limited. The public education system in Nepal is not very structured and for these kids who are already at a disadvantage because of the status or their orphanage, their education is even more vital. 
    The original plan had been to find sponsors through our connection of friends and family, and for me to just put together their bios and a short video of them talking about what their interests were. As I worked on interviewing each of them in their native language ( my iPhone and the microphone found on the apple headphones being my only filming tools), I realized that there was so much more I could contribute. Particularly within my own talents, since videography is not actually my area of interest. This led me to creating a website that potential sponsors could interact with to see which student they would be interested in sponsoring.

          Starting this project made me realize that I could combine my strengths to make a real contribution in education. These kids arenâ€™t the only ones without access to school, and scaling this project up from a focused 12-student website to a tool that is much larger would be incredible. There are many children around the world, or even just in that one city in need of education, and there are many people who have the means to provide them with one.
